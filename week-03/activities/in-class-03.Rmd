1. Using the blood pressure, data find the OLS estimators of $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$
and $\sigma^2$ for the model:
$$\text{blood pressure}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{height}_i + \epsilon_i$$.

1. Using the OLS from 1, calculate the expected blood pressure $\hat{\mu}_i$ for
each participant.

1. Use the expected value found in 2 ($\hat{\mu}_i$) to obtain the model 
residuals $\hat{\epsilon}_i$. 

1. What is the mean and variance of the residuals you found in 3?

1. Draw a histogram of the residuals

1. Draw a quantile-quantile plot of the residuals.

1. Draw a scatter plot of the residuals and stratify them using the sex 
variable. What can you see in the figure?

1. Draw an auto-correlation plot of the residuals, what can you see in the 
auto-correlation function.
