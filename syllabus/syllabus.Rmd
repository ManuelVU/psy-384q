<h4>
  Course Purpose:
</h4>
<p class="description-section">
  The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the application of some
  advanced statistical techniques, such as robust linear models, generalized
  linear models, and maximum likelihood estimation. This course is mainly 
  applied, which means that the focus will be in how to use these techniques 
  with "real" data. However, in order to use them properly  we will of course 
  have to learn some theory. Computations and data visualizations will be 
  handled using the R/RStudio computing environment.
</p>

<h4>
  Instructional Methods:
</h4>
<p class="description-section">
  Substantive materials will be delivered in the form of lectures, and class activities. 
  These activities will be in the form of case studies were we will apply the methods we 
  have learned to real data during class.
</p>

<h4>
  Office Hours:
</h4>
<p class="description-section">
  Tuesdays 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm in SEA 5.230. You can also email me to schedule an appointment. 
</p>

<h4>
  Materials:
</h4>
<p class="description-section">
  In addition to whatever you use to take notes, you will need to bring a laptop with R/Rstudio 
  installed to complete and submit in-class activities.
</p>

<h4>
Textbook:
</h4>
<p class="description-section">
  There is no required textbook for this class. We will primarily be using lectures and 
  and RMarkdown files for in class case studies and homework problems, all of which will be 
  provided via Canvas.
  Some supplementaty resources are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Alan Agresti (2012). Categorical Data Analysis. *Third edition*.
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>

<h4>
  Assignments:
</h4>
<p class="description-section">
  There are two type of assignments for this clase, the first one is take home case studies, 
  and the second one is a final project. Take home case studies will be in the form of an 
  RMarkdown file that describes a problem. The objective will be for you to find a way to 
  answer the posed problem using the methods seen in class, and write the results in a format
  that resembles the "Results" section of a paper.
</p>

<h4>
  Grades:
</h4>
<p class="description-section">
  Grades will be based on three components: in class participantion (completion of
  in-class case studies), homework case studies, and final project, with a weight of 20, 45, and 
  35% respectively. For the determination of letter grades at the end of the class, I will use 
  my predecessor’s graduate class grading scale: A=80+, B=60-79.99, C=59.99-and-below. 
  The graduate school now uses +/- designations in addition to simple letter grades:
  <ul>
    <li>
      a "+" is earned for a final grade in the upper third of the interval.
    </li>
    <li>
      the letter only for a final grade in the middle third.
    </li>
    <li>
      a "-" for a final grade in the lower third of the interval.
    </li>
  </ul>

  **Note:** the graduate school does not allow an A+ designation.
