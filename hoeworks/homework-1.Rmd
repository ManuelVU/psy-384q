You've been hired as a data analyst for a memory experiment. The objective of 
the study is to test if there are differences between recognition and free 
recall memory tasks when the stimuli used are low or high frequency words. The
file `memory_frequency.csv` contains data from the experiment. The variables
include an identification number (id) for each participant, a measure of the 
performance of each participant (memory), the experimental condition (condition,
can take values "recognition" or "free"), the type of stimulus (stimulus, can 
take values "low" or "high" for the frequency of words), and sex (sex, can take
values "female" and "male").
