1. Generate the needed variables for a simple linear regression model.

1. Simulate $k = 20$ "experiments"  each with a sample size of 40, and save the
parameter estimates of $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\sigma^2$.

1. Plot the histogram of the estimated values of $\beta_0$ and overlay the 
theoretical normal distribution.

1. Plot the histogram of the estimated values of $\beta_1$ and overlay the 
theoretical normal distribution.

1. Increase the number of experiments to 200 on step two and repeat steps 
from 2, 3, and 4.
