1. Make a plot of the average temperature by month stratified by city.

1. Estimate the parameters of a linear model that includes the city as a 
predictor of average temperature.

1. Plot the residuals as a function of the month.

1. Transform the month variable using the cosine function from the lecture.

1. Estimate the parameters of a model that includes the city, the month and the 
transformed value of the month as predictors of average temperature.

1. Estimate the BIC for the previous two models and compare them. Which one 
would you choose?

1. Plot the expected value for the average temperature as a function of month
stratified by city.
