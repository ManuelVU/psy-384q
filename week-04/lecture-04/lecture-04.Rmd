### Recap

- In the last class we ran our first multiple linear regression using age and 
sex as predictors of blood pressure.

--

- Adding the sex variable to our model made the residuals look better when 
plotted as a function of the observation order (id) which was not the case 
for the simple linear model.

--

- However, we still need to see that the residuals behave as expected (mean 0 
and constant variance) as a function of other variables.

### Residuals of a function of age

- When plotting the residuals as a function of age we can't see anything wrong 
immediately.

- However, we can still stratify our residuals by sex.

### Stratified residuals

- Once we look at the residuals of the model independently for each of our two
groups we can see that there's still a small bias in our model.

--

- For example, we noticed that on average our residuals for the female group
tend to increase as a function of age.

--

- While the residuals for the male group tend to decrease with age. 

--

- These type of results suggest to us that there might be an interaction between
the two variables.

---
### Interactions

- From the previous plots we can see that, once we stratify the residuals by 
sex, we can see a trend in the residuals:

--

  - Residuals for female participants increase as a function of age.
  
--

  - Residuals for male participants decrease as a function of age.
  
--

- This suggests that there might be an interaction between sex and age that 
could be important for the model.

---
### Adding interactions to an MLR

- Formally, we can express the interaction model as:
$$\text{blood pressure}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{age}_i + \beta_2\text{sex}_i + \beta_3\text{age}_i \text{sex}_i + \epsilon_i$$

--

- In R we can add interactions to a linear model in two different ways:

```{r}

mlr_int_1 <- lm(formula = blood_pressure ~ age + sex + age * sex, 
                data = blood)
mlr_int_2 <- lm(formula = blood_pressure ~ age:sex, data = blood)
```

--

- Just like before, the output of the function includes useful elements that we
can use to evaluate the model.

---
### Adding interactions to an MLR

- An important thing to note is that the `formula` notation that includes the
colon:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mlr_int_2 <- lm(formula = blood_pressure ~ age:sex, data = blood)
```

has a different interpretation of the estimated values in comparison to the 
notation that has the sums and products

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mlr_int_1 <- lm(formula = blood_pressure ~ age + sex + age * sex, 
                data = blood)
```

--

- The reason for this difference is that the model produced by the **colon**
notation model does not include a specific coefficient for age, and instead has 
one age coefficient (parameter) for each group.

### Conclusion

- Now that we have added interactions to the blood pressure model our estimated
residuals look good.

--

- Their mean is close to 0, they have constant variance (rectangle when plotted
against other variables), and they have a low auto-correlation which suggests 
independence.

--

- This seems to be a good model for our data but how can we know if it is?

--

- Furthermore, when do we decide to stop adding covariates (the $X$'s) to our
model?

--

- To answer these two questions we need to do a Null Hypotheses Test (NHT).

--

- This process is known as inference and it's one of the most popular approaches
in statistics.
