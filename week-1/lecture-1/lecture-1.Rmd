### Blood pressure

- Researchers at UT Austin want to study the relationship between systolic blood
pressure and age. They design a study to measure the blood pressure of 200 
individuals alongside other variables of interest.

--

- Let's first look at the data.

---
### Data: blood pressure

```{r dtable, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(
  data = blood,
  options = list(pageLength = 6), 
  rownames = FALSE)
```

---
### Data visualization
.panelset[
  .panel[.panel-name[blood pressure]
```{r hist-bp, echo=FALSE}
par(las = 1)
hist(x = blood$blood_pressure, ann = FALSE, axes = FALSE,
     border = "white", col = "#f8971f")
axis(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.2)
mtext(text = "Blood pressure", side = 1, cex = 1.7, line = 2.3)
box(bty = "l")
```
  ]
  .panel[.panel-name[Age]
```{r hist-age, echo=FALSE}
par(las = 1)
hist(x = blood$age,
     breaks = seq(from = min(blood$age), to = max(blood$age), by = 1),
     ann = FALSE, axes = FALSE,
     border = "white", col = "#005f86")
axis(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.2)
mtext(text = "Age", side = 1, cex = 1.7, line = 2.3)
box(bty = "l")
```
  ]
  .panel[.panel-name[Scatter plot]
```{r scater-bp-age, echo=FALSE}
par(las = 1)
plot(x = blood$age, y = blood$blood_pressure, data = blood, 
     ann = FALSE, axes = FALSE, col = "#00674f", pch = 19, cex = 1.4)
box(bty = "l")
axis(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.2)
axis(side = 2, cex.axis = 1.2)
mtext(text = "Blood pressure", side = 2, line = 2.8, cex = 1.7, las = 0)
mtext(text = "Age", side = 1, line = 2.5, cex = 1.8)
```
  ]
]

### Blood pressure vs age

- From the scatter plot it seems like a linear function would be a good starting
point to study the association between the variables of interest.

--

- The simple linear model can be expressed as: 
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \epsilon_i$$
---
### Notation:

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \epsilon_i$$

  - $i = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ is an indicator variable for the observation 
  number.
  
--

  - $Y_i$ is the **i-th** observation or outcome.
  
--

  - $X_{i1}$ is the predictor for the **i-th** observation.
  
--

  - $\beta_0$ is the intercept or the expected value of the outcome variable
  for an observation with a predictor with a value of 0.
  
--

  - $\beta_1$ is the slope or the rate of change of the expected value of the 
  outcome for a one unit difference in the predictor.
  
---
### Linear regression

- The simple linear model has two components:

--

  1. Systematic component (**aka** mean model) : $$\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1}$$

--

  1. Random component (**aka** error term): $$\epsilon_i$$
  
--

- For now we will assume that: $$\epsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2)$$

--

- This will make things easier for now, however, we will see that this 
assumption can be bent a little.

---
### What now?

- With our current specification we should be able to express a participant's
blood pressure as: $$\text{blood pressure}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{age}_{i} + \epsilon_i$$

--

- Notice that we don't know the values of $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ or 
$\epsilon_i$. If we had access to the entire population this would be easy, 
we just need to measure everyone's blood pressure and age in order to find those
values.

--

- This is very hard to do so instead of measuring the entire population we can
try to estimate those unknown values known as *parameters* from a sample of the
population instead.

---
### Parameter estimation

- How can we estimate the parameters of a model?

--

- We can think of estimation as a decision problem were we want to choose one 
or more values from a set of candidates. 

--

- For example, we could start by guessing that the values could be:

$\beta_0 = 100, \quad \beta_1 = 0.5, \quad \sigma^2 = 2$

--

- We can compare this first attempt with our data

---
### Example line

$$\mathrm{E}\left(\text{blood pressure}_i\right) = 100 + 1/2\ \text{age}_{i}$$

```{r example-line, echo=FALSE}
par(las = 1)
plot(x = blood$age, y = blood$blood_pressure, data = blood, 
     ann = FALSE, axes = FALSE, col = "white", bg = "#00674f",
     pch = 21, cex = 1.6)
curve(expr = 100 + 1/2 * x, from = min(blood$age), to = max(blood$age),
      add = TRUE, col = "#005f86", lwd = 4, lty = 2)
box(bty = "l")
axis(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.2)
axis(side = 2, cex.axis = 1.2)
mtext(text = "Blood pressure", side = 2, line = 2.8, cex = 1.7, las = 0)
mtext(text = "Age", side = 1, line = 2.5, cex = 1.8)
```

---
## Example line

- The previous plot showed us that a lot of our observations were above the line
so what can we do next?

--

- We can frame the problem of estimating the parameters of a model as a decision
problem!

--

- In this case, we want to find the values of the parameters that will let us 
optimize some criterion or function, which will depend on our candidate values
of each of the parameters in the model.

--

- We refer to these functions as **objective functions**.

--

**Note:** The derivative of these objective functions also has a name:
**score function**

---
### Objective functions

- There are many objective functions that we could choose from (eventually we 
will use different ones during this course).

--

- For now we will use what is known as the Mean Squared Error as an objective 
function.

--

- According to this criterion, we want to find the values of $\hat{\beta}_0$, 
and $\hat{\beta}_1$ that minimize the MSE.

$$\underset{\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1}{\operatorname{min}} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \left(y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1x_{i1}\right)^2$$

--

- This objective function has an intuitive interpretation and visualization.

---
### Solution: Normal equations

- We call the solution to of the optimization problem the Ordinary Least Squares
Estimators or **OLS** for short.

--

- The OLS for the simple linear regression can be expressed as:
$$\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1\bar{x}_1$$
$$\hat{\beta}_1 = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{(y_i - \bar{y})(x_{i1} - \bar{x}_1)}{(x_{i1}-\bar{x}_1)^2}$$

---
### Estimation of the variance

- To estimate the variance we use the unbiased estimator which is:
$$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-p} \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat{\mu}_i)^2$$

--

- were $p$ is the number of "betas" in the model and 
$$\hat{\mu}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_{i1}$$
