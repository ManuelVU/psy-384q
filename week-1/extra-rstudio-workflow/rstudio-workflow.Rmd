- Create a directory for the class, you can organize that directory
however you want but it's always better to have things in the same place. 

- Open Rstudio and create a project inside the directory you just created.
To create a new project:

  1. Go to `file` and `click` create a new project.
  <img src="file-new-proj.png"
  style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;
         margin-top:0.5cm;
         width:80%;
         display:block;
         margin-left:auto;
         margin-right: auto;">
  
  1. Then click on the "Existing Directory" option.
  <img src="existing-dir.png" 
  style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;
         margin-top:0.5cm;
         width:80%;
         display:block;
         margin-left:auto;
         margin-right: auto;">
  
  1. On the new window click the browse option and select the directory you 
  created in step one.
  
Projects allow us to organize our work and bypass the problem of setting a 
working directory every time we start working with a new data set.

Here is an example of a project organization:
<img src="organization-examp.png"
style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;
       margin-top:0.5cm;
       width:80%;
       display:block;
       margin-left:auto;
       margin-right: auto;">

When you open a project in RStudio, it automatically sets up the working 
directory to the root directory of the project.

## Now it's your turn.

1. Create a new directory named "extra" in your class directory.

1. Create a new directory named "`data`" in the "`extra`" folder.

1. Download the file "example.csv" located in the R/RStudio module on canvas, 
and then save that file to the "`data`" directory you created.

1. Open RStudio and start a new R markdown file.

1. Using a code chunk load the data into the environment (if your not sure how
check the cheat-sheet "`rmarkdown.pdf`")

1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the two variables in the data 
set and print them using the inline code function.

1. Draw a histogram of both variables (you can use base R or ggplot2, 
check the "`data-visualization.pdf`" cheat-sheet if you want to know how to 
do it in ggplot2).

1. Draw a scatter plot of x vs y.
