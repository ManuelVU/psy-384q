### Now it's your turn.

1. Download the data file `simple-lin-reg.csv` from canvas and using the 
normal equations seen in lecture estimate the value of the parameters $\beta_0$, 
$\beta_1$, and $\sigma^2$ for the model:
$$\text{blood pressure}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * \text{age} + \epsilon_i$$

\indent assuming that $\epsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim}N(0,\sigma^2)$.


2. Make a scatter plot of the association between blood pressure and age. Add
the regression line that you found in step 1.


3. Make a scatter plot that shows the association between blood pressure and age
stratified by sex (e.g. using different colors).
